### To-Do List for the Movie Recommendation System Project

1. Project Setup
   - Set up a new repository on GitHub.
   - Create a virtual environment and install necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Surprise, Flask/Streamlit).

2. Data Collection
   - Identify and download a movie dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or MovieLens).
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.

3. Data Preprocessing
   - Clean the dataset (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
   - Convert categorical data into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding for genres).
   - Normalize or standardize rating values if necessary.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualize the distribution of ratings and genres.
   - Analyze trends (e.g., most popular genres, top-rated movies).
   - Create correlation matrices to find relationships between features.

5. Model Development
   - Choose a recommendation approach (collaborative filtering or content-based).
   - For collaborative filtering:
     - Implement user-item matrix.
     - Use the Surprise library to build and train the model.
   - For content-based filtering:
     - Create a similarity matrix based on movie attributes.
     - Implement TF-IDF or word embeddings for descriptions.

6. Model Evaluation
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE or RMSE.
   - Adjust parameters and retrain as necessary.

7. Deployment
   - Create a simple user interface using Flask or Streamlit.
   - Implement functionality for users to input preferences and receive recommendations.
   - Ensure the interface is user-friendly and visually appealing.

8. Testing
   - Test the recommendation system with sample inputs.
   - Gather feedback on the accuracy and usability from friends or peers.

9. Documentation
   - Write documentation for the project, explaining the methodology, tools used, and how to run the application.
   - Create a README file for the GitHub repository with project description, objectives, and instructions.

10. Final Touches
    - Polish the user interface and fix any bugs.
    - Share the project on GitHub and consider showcasing it in your portfolio.
