# FilmFuse
A movie recommendation system that analyzes user preferences and movie attributes to suggest personalized film choices, enhancing the viewing experience.

## Objectives
- [ ] Gather a dataset of movies, including attributes like title, genre, ratings, and user reviews.
- [ ] Analyze the dataset to identify trends, popular genres, and correlations between ratings and genres.
- [ ] Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to suggest movies based on user preferences.
- [ ] Test the modelâ€™s accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Hints:

- **Dataset Sources**: Check out datasets on platforms like Kaggle or MovieLens.
- **Tools**: Use Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for building models.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Consider using the Surprise library for building recommendation systems easily.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Leverage TF-IDF or word embeddings to analyze movie descriptions for content similarities.
- **Deployment:** Think about using Flask or Streamlit to create a simple web app to showcase your recommendation system.
